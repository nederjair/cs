# Laboratory work 1
**all programs are written in `{python icon} python3`**

## problem 1
write a program which perform the following actions:
1. prints "Hello World!".
2. ask the user his name.
3. greets the user by his name.

2. what was or will be the user's age in the year `x`
---

## problem 3
write a program that perform the next actions:

1. initialize a variable `x` with the value of `2`.
2. add `3` to `x` and the result assign it to `x`.
3. calcualte `(x+1)/2` and assign the result to `x`.
4. calculate `x+1/2` and assign the result to `x`.
5. change the data type of `x` to `str` and assign the result to `x`.

**after every operation show the value of `x` and its type**
