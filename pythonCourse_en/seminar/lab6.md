### Problem 1

Create a dictionary where the keys are numbers and the values are strings. Apply the items() method to it, and pass the resulting dict_items object to the function you wrote, which creates and returns a new dictionary, the "inverse" of the original, i.e. the keys are strings and the values are numbers.

### Problem 2


Describe the data structure (database) based on the dictionary and the interface for working with it (function).

Create a dictionary school, and fill it with data that would reflect the number of students in different classes (1a, 1b, 2b, 6a, 7c, etc.). And a function for making changes to the dictionary within the framework of the following functionality:

a) the number of students in one of the classes has changed;
b) a new class has appeared in the school;
c) a class has been disbanded (deleted) in the school, as a result of which students have been evenly distributed among others;
d) data upload: total number of students in the school, total number of classes, distribution of students by classes.
