**all programs are written in `{python icon} python3`**
### problem 1
Write a program that finds the largest in a series of numbers entered by the user. The pro gram must prompt the user to enter numbers one by one. When the user enters 0 or a nega tive number, the program must display the largest nonnegative number entered:

```bash
Enter a number: 60
Enter a number: 38.3
Enter a number: 4.89
Enter a number: 100.62
Enter a number: 75.2295
Enter a number: 0
The largest number entered was 100.62
```

Notice that the numbers arenâ€™t necessarily integers.

```bash
Enter two integers: 12 28
Greatest common divisor: 4
```

### problem 3

```bash
Enter a fraction: 6/12
In lowest terms: 1/2
