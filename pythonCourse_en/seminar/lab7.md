# Laboratory work 7
**all programs are written in `{python icon} python3`**

### Problem 1

An arbitrary number of integer numbers is entered from the keyboard in one line. Write them to a file, placing each number on a separate line. from the file obtained in this way you must:

1. load the list of numbers, 
2. calculate their sum, maximum and minimum, 
3. add these values to the end of the file.

Run the program several times, make sure that the new values are taken into account when counting.

### Problem 2

Change the previous task so that the user can enter any characters, and the program writes them to the file. This should happen in a loop several times, and new data should be written to the file. After that, regardless of file reading errors, the program should calculate the sum, maximum, and minimum. And write these values to the end of the file.

### Problem 3

Information about the occupancy of seats in the cinema auditorium is stored in a text file. For example:

```bash
0 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1
```

where the row denotes the row, the column denotes the seat (0 - free, 1 - occupied).

Write a program that will allow the user to see 
1. the number of total free seats in the auditorium, 
2. the total number of seats in the auditorium, 
3. the number of free seats in the auditorium by each row,
4. by entering the row and seat number, the user obtain information about whether the seat is free or not.
