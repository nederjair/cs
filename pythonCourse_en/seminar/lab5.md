# Laboratory work 5
**all programs are written in `{python icon} python3`**

### Problem 1

Write a program that gets a string from the user where there are lowercase and uppercase letters, then:

1. if the number of uppercase letters is bigger than the number of lowercase letters in the string then the program converts all the letters in uppercase.

2. if the number of lowercase letters is bigger than the number of uppercase  letters in the string then the program converts all the letters in lowercase.

3. if the number of lowercase letters is equal to the number of uppercase letters in the string is not modified.


`For example, the string "HeLLO WORlD" is entered, it must be converted to "HELLO WORLD".`

The program can use string methods: Upper() (conversion to uppercase) and Lower() (conversion to the saved case), isupper() and islower() (checking strings or case symbols).

### Problem 2

The word **"object-oriented"** is given. Using indexing and slicing, make up as many words as possible, for example: "object", "oriented", jet, tend, etc. Display them on the screen.

---

### Problem 3

The string method **isdigit()** checks whether a string consists only of digits. Write a program that asks for integers from the input and outputs their sum. In case of incorrect input, the program should not terminate with an error, but should continue to work, removing all characters from the input string except for digits. If there are no digits, the request is repeated to the user.

The try-except exception handler cannot be used.
