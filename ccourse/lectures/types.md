Every variable in `{c icon} programming language` has a **type** which specifies what kind of data it holds. a type determines 3 main things:
1. what operations can be performed on that particular type.
2. how the values of that type are repersented.
3. how the data of a particular type is stored.

to start we will limit ourselfs to two datatypes, `int` and `float`.
