# First semester `{c icon}language` project

## Brief description
one of the following projects must be selected for its implementation in the C programming language:

1. embedded systems
2. terminal (operative system terminal) game
    - snake game
    - who wants to be a millionaire game
    - Sudoku game
    - guess a word game
3. function approximation library
4. lineal equation system solver
5. differential equation solver

## Requirements

1. **Original content** - you can get inspiration from others people code on internet, however write most of the code by yourself.
2. **A command line interface** - all the projects (exception - the embedded systems project) must have an user interface that allows the user interact with the program and get all the functionalities.
3. **Working functionality** - all the functionalities should work according to the goals of the project
4. **Structured program** - divide the project in chunks of code using as main criteria the functionalities of the project.
5. **Defense** - all the items in the written report must be explained to the teacher (online or presencial).
5. **Deadline** - sent everything before 20.12.2024
