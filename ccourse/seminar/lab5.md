**all the programs MUST be written `{c icon} c`**
### problem 1
Here’s a simplified version of the Beaufort scale, which is used to estimate wind force:

Speed (knots) | Description
-- | --
Less than 1 | Calm
1–3 | Light air
4–27 | Breeze
28–47 | Gale
48–63 | Storm
Above 63 | Hurricane

Write a program that asks the user to enter a wind speed (in knots), then displays the corresponding description.

$750–$2,250   | $7.50 plus 2% of amount over $750
$2,250–$3,750 | $37.50 plus 3% of amount over $2,250
$3,750–$5,250 | $82.50 plus 4% of amount over $3,750
$5,250–$7,000 | $142.50 plus 5% of amount over $5,250
Over $7,000   | $230.00 plus 6% of amount over $7,000
